According to https://github.com/rileytestut/AltStore,
"Due to the licensing of some dependencies used by AltStore, I have no choice but to distribute AltStore under the AGPLv3 license. That being said, my goal for AltStore is for it to be an open source project anyone can use without restrictions, so I explicitly give permission for anyone to use, modify, and distribute all my original code for this project in any form, with or without attribution, without fear of legal consequences (dependencies remain under their original licenses, however)."
Since AltBackup does not have any external dependencies, it is only subject to
"I explicitly give permission for anyone to use, modify, and distribute all my original code for this project in any form, with or without attribution, without fear of legal consequences".
